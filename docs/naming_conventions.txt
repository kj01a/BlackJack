Naming conventions
    Names are not for convinence, they are for communcating
    Communicate intent
    Avoid Disinformation
        If you have to read the code to understand a name, it is a bad name
    Pronouncable names
    Avoid encodings
    Choose parts of speech well
        Class, variable - nouns
        Functions - verbs
        Booleans - predicates
    Scope rule
        Variable names should be long when the variable is long in scope and
        short when short in scope.
        The opposite is true for classes and functions. Function names should be
        short for larger scope and long for short (private) scope.
