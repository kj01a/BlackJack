# blackjack

There are three main aspects to the game. 

##Game Engine

A game that plays blackjack with a single player and a dealer using multiple decks. I want it to be able to determine the best play according to basic strategy, and it will then determine whether or not the basic strategy play is optimal, based on a count using the Hi-Lo system. 

##Statistic Engine

This engine analyzes different aspects of the game. Such as win percentage, how randomized the cards are, common combinations of cards, etc...

##GUI

A simple interface showing the cards in play, what's been bet, and what chips the player has left.
